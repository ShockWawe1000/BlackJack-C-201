# C++ Blackjack Game

This project is a command-line implementation of the popular casino card game, Blackjack, written in C++. It provides an interactive gaming experience where players can play against the dealer and try their luck in reaching a hand value as close to 21 as possible without going over.

## Features

- Game Logic: The C++ Blackjack Game accurately simulates the rules and mechanics of the traditional Blackjack game. It allows players to place bets, receive initial cards, make decisions such as hitting or standing, and compete against the dealer's hand.

- Console Interface: The game features a console-based interface that provides an interactive experience. Players can view their cards, the dealer's cards, and receive prompts for their actions (hit, stand, etc.) through the console.

- Card Deck Management: The game manages a standard deck of 52 cards and properly handles shuffling, dealing, and card values. It ensures that cards are drawn randomly and accurately calculates the total value of a player's hand.

- Win/Loss Evaluation: The game accurately evaluates the outcome of each round, determining whether the player wins, loses, or pushes (draws) against the dealer. It updates the player's balance accordingly.
